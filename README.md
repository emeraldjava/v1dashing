# V1Dashing - an Agile Team's Dashboard

## Overview

As a coach, a member of a team, a Scrum Master, or a stakeholder, information is incredibly important.  This project is an example of what one can do with the elegance of an open source solution such as [Dashing.io](http://dashing.io) and the power of the best Agile Software Development tool -- [VersionOne](http://www.versionone.com).  Actually, full disclosure -- I work with VersionOne as an Agile Coach/Consultant learn more about me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattbadgley).  I was inspired by both the request for such a thing from customers as well as my own desire to learn and produce something others could value and learn from.  The result, I think, is pretty darn cool -- and functional.  

Dashing.io is a great solution from the folks at Shopify.  It is based on Ruby and leverages several other open source projects. It has some limitations around deployment and it's not responsive, but these are minor compared to the value it provides and overall ease of use.
