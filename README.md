# V1Dashing - an Agile Team's Dashboard

## Overview

As a coach, a member of a team, a Scrum Master, or a stakeholder, information is incredibly important.  This project is an example of what one can do with the elegance of an open source solution such as [Dashing.io](http://dashing.io) and the power of the best Agile Software Development tool -- [VersionOne](http://www.versionone.com) (full disclosure -- I work at VersionOne as an Agile Coach/Consultant). I was inspired by both the request for such a thing from customers as well as my own desire to learn and produce something others could value and learn from.  The result, I think, is pretty darn cool -- and functional.  

Dashing.io is a great solution from the folks at Shopify.  It is based on Ruby and leverages several other open source projects. It has some limitations around deployment/scaling and it's not responsive, but these are minor compared to the value it provides and overall ease of use. Check out http://shopify.github.com/dashing for more information.

The dashboard itself is targeted for agile teams that predominantly iterate (i.e. they have sprints) and they are at that point in their adoption that they find value in seeing the cycletime and looking at the cumulative flow.
