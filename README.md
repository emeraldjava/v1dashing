# V1Dashing - an Agile Team's Dashboard

## Overview

As a coach, a member of a team, a Scrum Master, or a stakeholder, information is incredibly important.  This project is an example of what one can do with the elegance of an opensource solution such as [Dashing.io](http://dashing.io) and the power of the best Agile Software Development tool -- [VersionOne](http://www.versionone.com).  Actually, full disclosure -- I work with VersionOne as an Agile Coach/Consultant learn more about me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattbadgley).  I was inspired by both the request for such a thing from customers as well as my own desire to learn and produce something others could value and learn from.  The result, I think, is awesome.  Dashing.io is a great solution from the folks at Shopify.
